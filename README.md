# Tony-AnamegeBankingApplication

This project is in partial fulfillment of my MIT Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. The Front End Banking Application required building, testing, and deploying a React banking application in addition to designing and building the UI components. While undertaking this project, I demonstrated my ability to use HTML, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Visual Studio Code, and Babel.

In this app, I created several functionalities including ability to create accounts, take deposits and make withdraws within certain parameters. I also created login page where bank clients can gain access to their accounts to make transactions upon validation of their identities.
