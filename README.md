# Tony-AnamegeBankingApplication

Project Title: Fullstack Banking Application.

Description: This project is in partial fulfillment of my MIT Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. The Banking Application required building and testing an app with limited security, and improving it to become secure using React. 

In this app, I created several functionalities including ability to create accounts, take deposits and make withdraws within certain parameters. I also created login page where bank clients can gain access to their accounts to make transactions upon validation of their identities. I finally refactored the app's front end to ensure routes are connecting to the backend and UI behaving as expected.
